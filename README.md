# Nathan Sizemore

Hey-o! I'm Nathan. I'm a Software Engineer who enjoys solving hard problems.
I enjoy Linux, Emacs, C, Rust, and 80-col widths. Fighting games and beer are
also super cool.

### About me

I've worked on everything from a single contact-form webpage, Enterprise
Scaleâ„¢ web sites, emotion recognition mobile apps, gun-shot detection
software, to the world's first human input VR attraction. I've worked with
too many languages and frameworks to count, but the pains and constraints
of each will stick with me forever. I like Linux because of its freedom,
Emacs for the macros, C because it's simple enough to keep in your head
but scary enough to make you think you ever could, Rust because it gives
you C with npm but no need to RTFM, and finally 80-col widths because it's
2019 but not everyone has a wide-screen display and people read code on a
phone screen.
