## About Me

I'm Nathan, a Software Engineer who enjoys solving hard problems. I enjoy
Linux, Emacs, C, Rust, and 80-col widths. Fighting games are also super cool.

I've worked on everything from a single contact-form webpage, enterprise scale
web sites, facial/emotional recognition apps, gun-shot detection
software, to the world's first human input VR attraction. I've worked with
too many languages and frameworks to count, but the pains, constraints, and
lessons learned along the way will stick with me forever. I like Linux because
of its freedom, Emacs for the macros, C because it's simple enough to keep
in your head but scary enough to make you think you ever could, Rust because
it gives you C with npm and no need to RTFM, and finally 80-col widths because
it's 2022 but not everyone has a wide-screen display and people sometimes read
code on phones.
