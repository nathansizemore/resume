## About Me

I'm Nathan, a Software Engineer who enjoys solving hard problems. I enjoy
Linux, Emacs, C, Rust, and 80-col widths. Fighting games are also super cool.

I've worked on everything from a single contact-form webpage, Enterprise
Scaleâ„¢ web sites, facial/emotional recognition apps, gun-shot detection
software, to the world's first human input VR attraction. I've worked with
too many languages and frameworks to count, but the pains and constraints
of each will stick with me forever. I like Linux because of its freedom,
Emacs for the macros, C because it's simple enough to keep in your head
but scary enough to make you think you ever could, Rust because it gives
you C with npm but no need to RTFM, and finally 80-col widths because it's
2022 but not everyone has a wide-screen display and people sometimes read
code on phones.

Rust has been my favorite language for about 8 years now. I was a very early
adopter and probably had the first at scale production server out there,
before the language was even stabilized. Some of my open source contributions
from writing that have made their way into AWS serverless VM layer(s) and into
the reMarkable tablets firmware. I've done everything with the language from
low latency networking to trying to use it for games on Android and OpenGL.
